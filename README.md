# Immersive Box Office - Decorator Demo

## Concept
Immersive Box Office (IBO) is an innovative ticket sale system, that transforms ticket purchase into an interactive and immersive experience. Through the most recent technologies of 3D for the web, IBO transports the buyer into an appealing and immersive 3D environment, simplifying the purchase of tickets, through a whole new navigation and virtual reality paradigm. Simultaneously, IBO simplifies the sales system through a web-based technology: WebGL, enabling a multi-platform and compatible usage. IBO intends to solve all the usability issues with current ticket sales systems, while rendering the whole process more interesting and desirable for end customers. IBO presents a series of innovative features like a 3D interactive interface, VR experience, Immersive Advertising and Multi-Platform compatibilities. 

This demo extends the features of IBO, by adding a new layer of customization to the original idea (see IBO vanilla repository) - it allows users to choose patterns and colors for different walls of the original room, through a simple and minimal user interface.

This demo was developed as a prototype to fit a customer's request.

## Tech
IBO was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) framework.
